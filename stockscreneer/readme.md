Hello everyone

These are 3 short lessons on how to build your Stock Screener and later add your own ideas to it.

In these episodes, we will discuss how to work with the Alpaca API, dates, and I / o in the terminal.

For those who already have experience in programming, it will not be difficult to figure out what to do and how to do it, for those who are still young, young and beautiful â€“ I left my contacts, which you can contact me.

Enjoy coding and welcome to the fun world of trading!
