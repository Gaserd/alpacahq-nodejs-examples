Hello everyone!

This is a repository where I gradually collect lessons and examples for working with the Alpaca API on NodeJS.

So, if you like trading and programming, you should definitely visit this repository and make your own adjustments here.

All lessons are constructed in such a way:
- There is a root folder in which there is readme.md which explains the essence of the lessons
- Then go to the folder with the lessons, which also has a readme.md and key files that you will need
- I strongly advise you to follow the instructions clearly and write to me if anything happens https://twitter.com/gaserdgg or email gaserd123@gmail.com
- There are also files that support other languages (so far only Russian)

If you want to help with writing or something else, then you know my contacts!

The first lesson is writing your own little Stock Screener and dealing with how to install NodeJS in General
